# Decisions

Decision records for significant architectural changes, major refactors, and major upgrades live here as standalone docs. Create one when a change alters system structure, introduces new patterns, or has broad consequences across the codebase.

## Template (One File Per Decision)

Filename: `ADR-<topic>.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`

Suggested structure:
- Context
- Decision
- Alternatives considered
- Consequences
- Rollout/notes (if applicable)
