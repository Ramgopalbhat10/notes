Current section: Story 20 — Workflow Enforcement via Git Hooks and CI Gates

Previous tasks (latest completed batch only):
- [x] Rename auth/CI secret env references from GITHUB_* to GH_*.

Next tasks:
- None - all tasks completed.

Notes:
- Hooks and CI now enforce documentation gates; branch protection should require `workflow-gates` status.
