Current section: Story 20 — Workflow Enforcement via Git Hooks and CI Gates

Previous tasks (latest completed batch only):
- [x] Add workflow instruction to check for relevant active branches/issues/stories before creating new work.
- [x] Update pre-push hook to run workflow/lint/build only when non-markdown files changed.
- [x] Update README hook documentation to explain docs-only skip behavior.

Next tasks:
- None - all tasks completed.

Notes:
- Hooks and CI now enforce documentation gates; branch protection should require `workflow-gates` status.
