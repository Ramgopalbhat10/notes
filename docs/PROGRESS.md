Current section: Story 20 — Workflow Enforcement via Git Hooks and CI Gates

Previous tasks (latest completed batch only):
- [x] Include deleted files in workflow docs gate changed-file detection.

Notes:
- Hooks and CI now enforce documentation gates; branch protection should require `workflow-gates` status.
