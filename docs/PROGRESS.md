Current section: Story 20 — Workflow Enforcement via Git Hooks and CI Gates

Previous tasks (latest completed batch only):
- [x] Fix commit-msg hook validator to handle pnpm argument separator.

Next tasks:
- None - all tasks completed.

Notes:
- Hooks and CI now enforce documentation gates; branch protection should require `workflow-gates` status.
