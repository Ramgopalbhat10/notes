Current section: Story 21.7 — Public Mobile Outline Header Close Alignment

Previous tasks (latest completed batch only):
- [x] Replace the default absolute sheet close placement in public mobile outline with a header-row close action.

Next tasks:
- [ ] Execute manual smoke checks for title dedupe, bullet rendering, and public outline behavior.

Notes:
- Story 21.7 completed with public mobile outline header-row close alignment; `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build` pass (existing non-blocking workspace warnings remain about `baseline-browser-mapping` staleness and multiple lockfiles root inference).
