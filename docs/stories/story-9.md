# Story 9 — GitHub OAuth Access Control

Goal: Lock the Notes application behind GitHub OAuth using BetterAuth so only the owner's GitHub account can sign in and call privileged APIs, with session/state persisted in Turso via Drizzle ORM.

## Scope
- In: BetterAuth server setup, GitHub provider wiring, middleware/session checks, protected server actions and API routes, minimal sign-in UI, Drizzle adapter using Turso for BetterAuth persistence.
- Out: Multi-user support, audit logging, role-based access, non-Turso database backends.

## Deliverables
- Server: BetterAuth instance with GitHub provider limited to a single allowed username/email, Turso-backed Drizzle adapter, catch-all auth route, helpers for session checks.
- Runtime: Middleware that enforces authentication on pages and API routes, returning 401 or redirecting as appropriate.
- Client: Sign-in/out affordances and session awareness for gated UI; docs describing credential setup and environment configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Only the configured GitHub account can sign in; other accounts are denied with a helpful error.
- Unauthenticated requests to protected pages/APIs redirect to sign-in or return 401 JSON.
- Signed-in user can access UI and tree endpoints without extra headers.
- Environment variables documented and validated at runtime, including Turso connection details.
- Session and account records persist in Turso and survive server restarts.

## Story 9.1 — BetterAuth Backend Setup
- API
  - Add `app/api/auth/[...betterauth]/route.ts` forwarding GET/POST to BetterAuth `handleAuth`.
  - Export `auth`, `getSession`, and `requireUser` helpers from `lib/auth/betterauth.ts` for reuse.
- Behavior
  - Initialize BetterAuth with `github()` provider, restricting allowed accounts via `process.env.GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGIN`.
  - Persist BetterAuth data with the [Drizzle adapter](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/adapters/drizzle) configured for Turso per [Drizzle’s Turso guide](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/connect-turso).
  - Ensure the fallback cookie cache still functions, but database sessions survive restarts.
  - Surface clear errors when required env vars are missing at startup.

Steps to obtain GitHub OAuth credentials
1. Navigate to <https://github.com/settings/developers> and click “New OAuth App”.
2. Set application name and homepage URL (use your custom domain or `http://localhost:3000` for development).
3. Configure the Authorization callback URL to `https://<your-vercel-domain>/api/auth/callback/github`; add `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github` for local development.
4. Under *Scopes* (OAuth App) or *Permissions and events* (GitHub App) enable **user:email** read access so BetterAuth can verify the primary email returned by GitHub; GitHub Apps require setting *Account permissions → Email addresses → Read-only*.
5. After creation, copy the Client ID and generate a Client secret. Store them in `.env.local` as `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, and mirror them in Vercel project settings.
6. Record your GitHub login (username or primary email) in `GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGIN` so BetterAuth denies any other account.

Sub-tasks
- [x] Install BetterAuth packages and configure env schema for secrets.
- [x] Implement `lib/auth/betterauth.ts` with GitHub provider and helpers.
- [x] Add the auth catch-all API route and export GET/POST handlers.
- [x] Install Drizzle dependencies (`drizzle-orm`, `@libsql/client`) alongside tooling (`drizzle-kit`, `@better-auth/cli`).
- [x] Add Turso connection environment variables (`TURSO_DATABASE_URL`/`TURSO_DB_URL`, `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`/`TURSO_DB_TOKEN`) and load them in BetterAuth initialization.
- [x] Define the Drizzle client and adapter wiring (e.g., `lib/db.ts`, `lib/auth/index.ts`) and ensure migrations capture BetterAuth tables.
- [x] Document schema/migration commands (`pnpm auth:schema`, `pnpm db:generate`, `pnpm db:migrate`) and include them in project README when Story 9 ship.

Test Plan
- Missing env vars trigger descriptive errors in logs/build.
- Signing in with the allowed GitHub account succeeds; others receive “Access denied”.
- Callback URL works locally (`localhost:3000`) and on Vercel custom domain.
- Turso tables populate with session/user/account rows and persist after server restarts.

## Story 9.2 — Client & Access Guard
- Middleware
  - Use `middleware.ts` to call BetterAuth session check; redirect unauthenticated page requests to `/auth/sign-in`, return 401 for API calls.
  - Exclude static assets and auth routes from guarding.
- UI
  - Provide a dedicated sign-in screen built with shadcn/ui primitives (`Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, `Button`, `Separator`) that advertises GitHub OAuth and calls `authClient.signIn.social({ provider: "github" })`.
  - Embed session status in the main layout using shadcn/ui `Avatar`, `Badge`, and `DropdownMenu` components for quick sign-out, account info, and navigation.
  - Display the signed-in GitHub username/email for confirmation; hide gated features until session is ready.
- API Protection
  - Update tree and filesystem routes (`app/api/tree/*`, `app/api/fs/list`) to call `auth()` and verify the GitHub login before performing work.
  - Ensure refresh/status endpoints keep existing secret checks while also requiring the session.

Sub-tasks
- [x] Implement `middleware.ts` logic with session guard and redirects.
- [x] Update protected API routes to enforce BetterAuth user checks.
- [x] Build the shadcn/ui sign-in card/CTA on `/auth/sign-in` and wire it to `authClient.signIn.social({ provider: "github" })`.
- [x] Add session-aware header/sidebar controls with shadcn/ui `Avatar`, `Badge`, `DropdownMenu`, and `Button` for sign-out.

Test Plan
- Visiting protected pages unauthenticated redirects to sign-in; APIs return 401 JSON.
- Authenticated session grants access across pages and API fetches (e.g., `/api/tree`).
- Sign-out clears session and returns user to sign-in screen; middleware blocks further access.

---

## Definition of Done
- BetterAuth with GitHub OAuth restricts access to the single configured GitHub account.
- Middleware and API guards prevent anonymous or unauthorized usage.
- Documentation covers environment variables and GitHub credential setup for future maintenance.
